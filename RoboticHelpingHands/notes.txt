Little notes
-----------------------

[When Powering ESP32 Externally]
-Make sure power supply is >5V
-Use VIN PIN for Powering
-Remove Serial Baut as it's not needed

[APDS9960 Sensor]
-0x9E FOR HILETGO, editted in header and source file of SparkFun_APDS9960 Library
-TO RECONFIGURE SPARKFUN LIBRARY TO ACCEPT 2 BUS, OUTLINED
-Add in header:
    SparkFun_APDS9960(TwoWire *wire); -> under public class definition
    TwoWire *_wire; -> under private class definition
    

[Training/Serial reading from python]
-Doesn't use INTERRUPT PIN and instead uses polling
-Polling comes with Uses pull-up resistors for I2C
-Make sure no delays between accessing serial through .py and in gesture logic

-double_shake; start with bottom of fist facing sensor, and twisting wrist towards sensor twice
-double_tap; loose fist and is 'double' tapped/shaken towards sensor
-palm_down; starts with loose fist palm up far from sensor and moves from while twisting up palm down
-palm_up; starts with loose fist palm down close to sensor and moves back while twisting up palm up
-swipe_inward; hand starts from the outside of the sensor and swipes in
-swipe_outward; hand start from the inside of the sensor and swipes out
