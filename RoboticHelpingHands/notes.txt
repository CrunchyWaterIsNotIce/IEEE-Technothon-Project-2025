Little notes
-----------------------

[When Powering ESP32 Externally]
-Make sure power supply is >5V
-Use VIN PIN for Powering
-Remove Serial Baut as it's not needed

[APDS9960 Sensor]
-0x9E FOR HILETGO, editted in header and source file of SparkFun_APDS9960 Library

[Training/Serial reading from python]
-Doesn't use INTERRUPT PIN and instead uses polling
-Polling comes with Uses pull-up resistors for I2C
-Make sure no delays between accessing serial through .py and in gesture logic
